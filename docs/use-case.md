# Use Case 1: Find Package using description
A user is attempting to find a specific package (terminal tool) that allows them to perform a task that they otherwise would not be able to complete. The user knows that they are looking for something to allow them to execute a type of file. Through the use of the search bar in HomebrewGUI, the user is able to type in the file type and the words 'compiler' or 'interpreter' which showcases a list of relevant packages/programs that the user can install. The user finds a package that has a description stating that it can run said file type. The user can easily click the `install` button and use the command in their terminal to run the file.
